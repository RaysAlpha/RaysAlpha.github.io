  <hr>
  <p>I decided to major in MIS mainly in part due to the job opportunities that it would provide me. I know for a fact that there is always a demand for tech related
jobs, and just want to ensure that I have a degree and experience in something that will assist me in the future. On a personal note, my parents also suggested 
for me to enter business for my studies. During my highschool years, I had already taken engineering classes, computer science classes, and health service classes.
I didnâ€™t find any of these classes particularly enjoyable, but was able to accept programming to a certain extent. As such, I began to lean towards business. The
Pandemic played a large hand in my overall decision, because I got to see how overworked healthcare workers were becoming, but I also witnessed lack of appreciation
by many as well. I did not want to end up in a scenario like that in the future, so my decision to enter business was solidified. After taking a few classes in my 
first semester, coupled with some research, I decided that MIS would be a good major to support my future.</p>
